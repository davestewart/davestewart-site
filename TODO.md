## Ideas

Small portfolio site:

- show ONLY the things that matter
- a pick projects and share them (via a URL)
- session analytics (what did you look at?)

Better bio:

- data
- timeline
  - aggregate from items?

How do I advertise ME to get a job?

- people actually WANT that (it's not just self-indulgent)

Show your decisions:

- don't just show what you used
- show WHY you used it
- what led to that decision?
- help people hire you

Project idea:

- AI summaries, based on what you clicked on so far
- ask users what they want from the seession
- have AI summarise it
- conversation on one side, visuals on the other
- download a PDF for your session

BIO:

- create logos
- love the detail
- always thinking about things
-
